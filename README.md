# Nutrition Facts
### Project Purpose:
Nutrition Facts is an application that allows a user to find out how many calories, protein (g), carbs (g), fiber (g), and fat (g) in a desired food and keep track of those foods. A user is able to save foods to another web page and is able to delete foods that are no longer of interest. 

### Technical Details
Nutrition Facts is a Full Stack application that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL. Vanilla JS is used on the front end along with HTML and CSS for the sturcture and the design. The backend of the application is built using Express. A PostgreSQL database is used to store the information about the different foods. All changes made to the database by the user are done using Sequelize schema migrations.
